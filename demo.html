            indent_style: set to tab or space to use hard tabs or soft tabs respectively.
indent_size: a whole number defining the number of columns used for each indentation level and the width of soft tabs (when supported). When set to tab, the value of tab_width (if specified) will be used.
tab_width: a whole number defining the number of columns used to represent a tab character. This defaults to the value of indent_size and doesn't usually need to be specified.
end_of_line: set to lf, cr, or crlf to control how line breaks are represented.
charset: set to latin1, utf-8, utf-8-bom, utf-16be or utf-16le to control the character set.
trim_trailing_whitespace: set to true to remove any whitespace characters preceding newline characters and false to ensure it doesn't.
insert_final_newline: set to true to ensure file ends with a newline when saving and false to ensure it doesn't.
root: special property that should be specified at the top of the file outside of any sections. Set to true to stop .editorconfig files search on current file.
For any property, a value of unset is to remove the effect of that property, even if it has been set before. For example, add indent_size = unset to undefine indent_size property (and use editor default).

Currently all properties and values are case-insensitive. They are lowercased when parsed. Generally, if a property is not specified, the editor settings will be used, i.e. EditorConfig takes no effect on that part. For any property, a value of unset is to remove the effect of that property, even if it has been set before. For example, add indent_size = unset to undefine indent_size property (and use editor default).

It is acceptable and often preferred to leave certain EditorConfig properties unspecified. For example, tab_width need not be specified unless it differs from the value of indent_size. Also, when indent_style is set to tab, it may be desirable to leave indent_size unspecified so readers may view the file using their preferred indentation width. Additionally, if a property is not standardized in your project (end_of_line for example), it may be best to leave it blank.
